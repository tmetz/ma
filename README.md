## About the Three-Bucket Strategy

The three-bucket strategy is a tax-optimization method for saving and investing:

1. **Tax-Deferred Bucket** (Traditional 401k, Traditional IRA): Get a tax deduction now, pay taxes in retirement
2. **Tax-Free Bucket** (Roth 401k, Roth IRA): Pay taxes now, enjoy tax-free growth and withdrawals
3. **Taxable Bucket** (Regular brokerage accounts): No tax advantages, but maximum flexibility
